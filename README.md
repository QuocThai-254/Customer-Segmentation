# Customer-Segmentation
I did this project for the purpose of practising coding and using some frameworks like Pyspark, Sklearn as well as reviewing the algorithms of machine learning.

This is a notebook using the Customer Segmentation Dataset on Kaggle following this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vetrirah/customer

In this notebook, I try to read and visualize some features of this dataset. Then I try to do some preprocessing steps like refilling some null values, dropping unused columns, mapping values to numbers,... Then use supervised and unsupervised learning models to do classification task.
