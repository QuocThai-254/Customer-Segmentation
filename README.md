# Customer-Segmentation
I did this project for the purpose of practising coding and using some frameworks like pyspark, sklearn as well as reviewing the algorithms of machine learning.

This is a notebook using Customer Segmentation Dataset on Kaggle following this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vetrirah/customer

In this notebook I try to read and visualize some features of this dataset, then I try to do some preprocessing step like: refill some null values, drop unused columns, map values to numbers,... Then use suppervised and unsuppervised learning model to do classification task
